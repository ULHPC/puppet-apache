------------------------------------------------------------

Your website is configured in the directory <%= scope.lookupvar('apache::params::wwwdir') %>/<%= @servername %>

Directory organization 
-----------------------

* `config/`: you'll find here symlinks to the Apache configuration file(s) of this vhost.

* `htdocs/`: this is where you put the files you are publishing on your website.
  The first presented to the visitors (eg: when they visit "http://<%= @servername %>/")
  must be named "index.html". "index.php" also works for PHP websites.

* `cgi-bin/`: this is where you put perl or shell scripts that will be executed when they are
   accessed by visitors. The content of this directory is available at this
   address: http://<%= @servername %>/cgi-bin/

* `private/`: in this directory you can store any data that needs to be accessible by the
   web server but not published on the web. For example password files or user
   sessions.

* `logs/`: you will find in this directory the full access and error logs for your
   website. Actually, they are symbolic liks to the real log files of your web site, 
   namelly: 

 * `<%= scope.lookupvar('apache::params::logdir') %>/<%= @servername %>_error.log`
 * `<%= scope.lookupvar('apache::params::logdir') %>/<%= @servername %>_access.log`

* `certificates/`: if you have https enabled for this site, the SSL certificates of your 
  website will be located here.
